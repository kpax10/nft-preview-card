## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first time attempting a hover effect with an image and color overlay.

```css
.img-container:hover .overlay {
    opacity: 0.5;
    transition: .3s all ease-in-out;
}
```
### Continued development

I would like to better understand the relative vs absolute position relationship in CSS.
The overlay icon has opacity when it shouldn't. This will be fixed as soon as I can find a solution.
